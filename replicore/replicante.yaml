# Section for settings that will move to the DB once namespaces are fully introduced.
# For the time being, these options allow the system to pretend a namespace is available
# when needed but without hacing to implement all the details around them
# (DB changes, API changes, namespace provisioning, more ...)
#
# This is hardly good design but it helps more quickly get to playbooks.
# Once initial playbooks functionality is implemented, namespaces WILL be added next.
