# Playgrounds
Playgrounds are containerised processes that run distributed
datastores locally so that replicante can be developed, tested, and demoed.

Playgrounds are built using `replidev` to read a custom YAML definition and start `podman` pods.


## Code of Conduct
Our aim is to build a thriving, healthy and diverse community.  
To help us get there we decided to adopt the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
for all our projects.

Any issue should be reported to [stefano-pogliani](https://github.com/stefano-pogliani)
by emailing [conduct@replicante.io](mailto:conduct@replicante.io).  
Unfortunately, as the community lucks members, we are unable to provide a second contact to report incidents to.  
We would still encourage people to report issues, even anonymously.

In addition to the Code Of Conduct below the following documents are relevant:

  * The [Reporting Guideline](https://www.replicante.io/conduct/reporting), especially if you wish to report an incident.
  * The [Enforcement Guideline](https://www.replicante.io/conduct/enforcing)


## Quick start
Playgrounds are a way to speed up Replicante's development as well as demo it and experiment with it.

For an introduction on how to use them, check out the [quick start guide](https://www.replicante.io/quick-start/).
